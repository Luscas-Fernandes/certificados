 All my certificates and its respective exercises

> Exercises and certificates
All the certificates and exercises are in its respective folders.

> Why the C For Beginners folder has no exercises, just the certificate?
I've got this certificate prior to start organizing in this structure, I didn't used to save the exercises,
so I ended up losing the excercises in regard to this certificate.
